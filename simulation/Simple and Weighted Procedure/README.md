- **Comparison 1**: Fix the proportion of each covariate (`pi_cov_1 = pi_cov_2 = 0.5`), change the size of block1 (`pi_1`) from 0.1 to 0.5.

- **Comparison 2**: Fix the size of each block (`pi_1 = pi_2 = 0.5`), change the proportion of each covariate (`pi_cov_1`) in both block from 0.1 to 0.5.

- **Comparison 3**: Fix the proportion of each covariate in block1 (`pi_cov_11 = pi_cov_12 = 0.5`), change the size of block1 (`pi_1`) from 0.1 to 0.9 and change the proportion of each covariate in block2 (`pi_cov_21`) from 0.1 to 0.5.
