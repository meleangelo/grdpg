In each plot, y axis represent the difference between estimated beta and true beta. The smallest the value in y axis, the better the estimation. 

For Test_beta, n=2000, latent position = (0.425,0.575), balanced block size and balanced covariate size.
               beta takes value from -0.15 to 0.7

For Test_p_q, n=2000, balanced block size and balanced covariate size, beta=0.15, latent position = (p,q)
              q=1-p, and p takes value from 0.1 to 0.45
              
For Test_unbalanced_blocks, n=2000, beta = 0.15, latent position = (0.425,0.575), balanced covariate size. 
                            The proportion of the first block takes value from 0.1 to 0.5
                            
For Test_unbalanced_cov, n=2000, beta = 0.15, latent position = (0.425,0.575), balanced block size. 
                            The proportion of the first covariate block takes value from 0.1 to 0.5
